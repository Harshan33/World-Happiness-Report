**World Happiness Report Analysis**
=====================================

This repository contains an analysis of the World Happiness Report, a survey conducted by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Earth Institute at Columbia University. The report ranks countries based on their citizens' self-reported levels of happiness and well-being.

**Data Cleaning**
---------------

The original dataset was obtained from the kaggle and . The data was cleaned and preprocessed using Python and the Pandas library to:

* Handle missing values and outliers
* Convert data types to ensure consistency
* Merge datasets from different years
* Create new features for analysis

**Data Visualization**
---------------------

The cleaned dataset was then visualized using [insert visualization libraries/tools, e.g. Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly] to gain insights into the relationships between happiness and various factors such as:

* GDP per capita
* Social support
* Healthy life expectancy
* Freedom to make life choices
* Generosity
* Perceptions of corruption

The visualizations include:

* Bar charts and scatter plots to compare happiness scores across countries and over time
* Heatmaps to identify correlations between variables
* Interactive dashboards to explore the data in more detail

**Findings**
------------

The analysis reveals [insert key findings, e.g. "a strong positive correlation between GDP per capita and happiness scores", "a significant increase in happiness scores over the past decade in certain regions", etc.].

**Repository Structure**
-------------------------
